Todos:

 - give some kind of visual feedback (color?) when the input is changed,
   and reset the color when `validate` is pressed
 - get bower configured properly
 - run tests in ?Selenium?
 - use a build tool like grunt. Some build tasks:
 
   - jshint
   - r.js

 - consider allowing only object/array at top level since that's what
   RFC 4627 says and I've tried to follow the spec elsewhere
 - add Github "fork me" banner
